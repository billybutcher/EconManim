# EconManim
Manim code for Basic Economics animation visuals.
I did this for my Econ class in Ateneo last 3rd year intersession.

Git clone 3Blue1Brown's version of manim and do the necessary steps to install.

My code will not work with Manim Community Edition.

This repository only exists because I want it to be on the record that I know how to use manim. All the effort I put into reading manim's horrible documentation and troubleshooting its quirks can't go to waste.
If you're an organization in need of manim skills, please hire me. Contact me at justin.m.tan@obf.ateneo.edu
